0:06,SM:,"Testing 123. Testing 123. Testing 123. [Background comments: Great, super. I have to go back and forth here. Is that TV set on over there or? I guess I will not bother.] When you look at the boomer generation before we get into Native American boomers that is the question. The first question I want to ask is, do Native American boomers those individuals born after 1946, do they identify with this generation of young people that were involved? I know the American Indian Movement was a very important movement and from (19)69 to (19)73 but when you talk about the boomer generation, do you and do Native Americans as a whole identify with that group?",
1:02,PS:,"Yeah, it is kind of a good question. I am trying to remember when I first was familiar with that term, the boomer generation, and like, you know what I made of it at the time, what I think of it now. So, I do not know, I cannot say.",
1:22,SM:,"I will let you hold this and check this every so often to make sure it is working properly. I know what I am saying, but I want to make sure.",
1:28,PS:,"Okay, this is good.",
1:30,SM:,Yep.,
1:31,PS:,"Okay. So I cannot recall a lot of Indian people I know talking about themselves as boomers but you know, the changes that happened in the United States, you know, post-World War II and someone like me coming of age in the late 1960s. You know, it is clear there was a national and global phenomenon going on. But I think how people connected to that or, you know, if they felt, you know, what they had in common with other people in the same generation, I am not sure. But I think there was definitely a sense of, you know, events happening that, you know, that you are a part of that are the circumstance about, you know, global economy and national events. So I do not know, it is a funny word ""boomer"" right, it is like you are trying to same, you know, Generation X and Generation Y. You sort of sense, it is sort of, you know, part of this idea of naming something, you know?",Native Americans
2:44,SM:,"You state something, and in some of the things that you have written that you and your cohort when you wrote that first book, believed that what the counterculture was to white Americans and what the civil rights movement was to black Americans, the American Indian Movement was to Native Americans. And I would like to define it in two ways: number one, how important the American Indian Movement was during that four or five year period, but link it with also that the period prior too, which was ""red power"", which was like, because I can remember that when I was a student about the Mohawk nation up in Syracuse. They were furious about their land being taken away, and they got students from Syracuse and Binghamton. They were all working together to stop the highway from going through their land. That was Red Power.",
3:37,PS:,"Yeah, I mean, the discussion about boomers and activism obviously overlaps hugely with the idea of the (19)60s. So one of the things that is interesting about Native activism is that, you know, the first really huge major event did not happen until one month before that decade was over. It was in November 1969, at Alcatraz. So, you know, I talked about it as us being late to the party in a way, you know. There was important activism before then and you can look at the nature, when you talk about Red Power. That was characterized by college students, native college students, who had a completely different kind of aesthetic to their, to their movement. There were people who read the New Republic, they were people who unselfconsciously called themselves intellectuals (this is like: 1964, 1965, 1966) and that was also the look of, you know, the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, for example, you know. So those things were quite similar. In terms of people about the American Indian Movement, you know, that is an organization that was formed in 1968. But it is real impact came, you know, not really until the early (19)70s. So, you know, it is interesting to talk about the (19)60s in activism in terms of Native people and see that, you know, most of it was happening after, you know, a very powerful anti-war movement. You know, it was already established. And obviously, there were activists who were part of the anti-war movement. Some of the leaders, early leaders of the American Indian Movement, talked about being influenced by the Black Panther Party. Looking at some of the tactics they use to challenge you know, police practices in major cities. You know, people were partly you know, watching television and reading some of the same books. Yeah.",
3:37,SM:,"Yeah, yeah, a lot of the upstate, two individuals in particular, Newt Gingrich when he came to power in 1994, and then George Will, throughout his career as a writer, always take shots. They love taking shots at the (19)60s generation, and all the activism that was taking place. And oftentimes they say that a lot of the reasons why we have the breakdown in American society today, with the unbelievable divorce rate, with the drug culture, lack of; no sense of responsibility, disliking people in positions of authority, it all goes back to that era. And basically the student activists. And those 15 percent of seventy-eight million that were involved, whether it be the anti-war movement, the women's movement, Native American movement, Chicano, the environmental, all those individuals gay and lesbian, all the ones that were in the movements. They like to blame them. Of course, generalizations are not good but when you hear that, when you see someone writing about that, even when you think of AIM, it is really attacking AIM too. What are your thoughts? As people reflected on those times today? They like, everybody likes to place blame on things.",
7:30,PS:,"Yeah. I think there was a great deal of ̶ there was ̶ There was a lot going on. So I think, you know, there was at times, a sense of self-congratulation and hype about, you know, the (19)60s, about activism about the counterculture and for me, I think one of the important things to look at the Indian Movement was to take kind of a more dispassionate examination of that. To really try to see what, what the consequences actually were. And, you know, something like AIM or the Panthers or the anti-war movement become so polarized. You know, it is very hard to actually have the kind of conversation, you know that I think we need. So, so the American Indian Movement was for a couple of years by far the most influential and popular quasi-organization and there are implications of it, you know, thirty years later. So, I have been interested as somebody that was part of it towards the end of it is, you know, successful years to take you know, to take a hard look at all of that. The consequences of it. One of the reasons that Robert Warrior and I wrote our book ""Like a Hurricane"", was that we would meet people like, he was teaching at Stanford, I think then and he would meet Indian students whose parents had actually been activists in AIM and all they really knew about AIM was, you know, a movie like Thunder Heart, you know, with Val Kilmer or just a lot of representations that, you know, not even an issue what they are being correct or not, but just obviously very superficial and coming from a different place. So it is a lot about trying to look at that history more seriously, and engage it. So you know, we saying clearly that we are just, you know, extraordinary heroism and bravery and intelligence, and fantastically stupid decisions, a culture of thuggishness, you know, certainly took hold. And I think all those things have to be looked at, you know. I do not know I mean to talk about like, blaming these movements, you know, for things that are going on today. I do not know what that is really what interest that really serves. But I think taking those movements really seriously looking at all the sacrifices that people made, looking at what actually was accomplished. You know, that is sort of what, you know, I was trying to do with that project.",
9:27,SM:,"You okay? When you say 'thuggishness' was that? Would that be what happened to the Students for Democratic Society when they became violent? When the Black Panthers, although they were Bob (Seale) and (Pete) O'Neal's program, there is a lot of people that consider them a violent group and they took guns. Is that what you are saying about the Native American movement? AIM, in the beginning, and then it changed toward the end? It became even much more militant?",Students for a Democratic Society
10:43,PS:,"Yeah, I guess it is similar in some ways, you know. AIM as opposed to SDS, you know, never was a real organization. Anybody could join at any time. There were like five different national leaders, you know, a national chairman, a president, an executive director, things like that. So, so you could not have any real accountability in that situation but there was certainly, you know, an element that really believed in armed struggle, you know, that really believed in, you know, the kind of, the kind of, I guess without the discipline of the Weathermen or something but certainly, you know, there were elements of AIM that really relate to guns, you know.",Students for a Democratic Society
11:23,SM:,"Your upbringing. Where were you born? And at what moment? Were your parents, the ones really, obviously young people are finding their friends. But then there comes a point as a young person, you are starting to identify with one's culture. Who was the most influential person in your life in say, those first ten to fifteen years? Who influenced you the most? And you became sensitized to issues of Native Americans.",Childhood
11:50,PS:,"Me and my two sisters, we were all born in West Texas, although we have virtually no memory of it because my family moved to Upstate New York briefly, so my dad could get a doctorate at Cornell. But we, both my parents are from Oklahoma. My dad, a white guy who actually is now an enrolled Choctaw. My mom Comanche. So I know we were very connected with Oklahoma. They sort of hated Oklahoma, which is why they wanted to leave, but then we always went back. So this was, you know, growing up in the 1960s. It was because we mostly me and my sisters who mostly lived in Washington, DC, but we were pretty connected with Oklahoma. So when I was growing up, my grandfather, my mom's Dad, you know, he still was minister of the Comanche Reformed Church, and they still did certain church services in ̶ and Comanche so it is not like I was disconnected from that. I was not around it all the time. But it was before the sort of cultural renewal, you know, really took off in the later (19)60s. So it was not, there is something very Oklahoma about it and that you know, this church that had been around since the turn of the century. And, you know, you see all these pictures, you see all this history of it. But it is not like my mother's side of the family talked about the old days in any particular narrative of either struggle or resistance or anything, you know, my mom, so my mom's brothers were in the military in World War II. They could not, none of none of my mom or siblings could go to like powwows or anything like that. And, you know, it is was like a lot of the US and the world was at that time, you know, the middle of the 20th century, which was not about us hanging on to our language, no matter what, let us keep our ceremonies, you know, let us do all that. And so now we pretend that we always were like that, but that is just not really true. Certainly not a place like Oklahoma. So, I would say for me and my sisters, you know, coming of age in the late (19)60s you are influenced by all kinds of things. And we certainly were. So all of us were, you know, all of us connected with, you know, seeing world in different ways. For me, it was politics for my younger sister it was going to Institute of American Indian Arts, Santa Fe. My sister also worked at Indian organizations for some graduate studies. So we were part of that. I think that is where a lot of people learn, like that.",Childhood
14:23,SM:,"[Inaudible for a minute] Testing one, two. That is better.",
15:13,PS:,It seems better to me. What is wrong with it? Sounds fine.,
15:15,SM:,I do not know why I did that.,
15:17,PS:,Oh okay.,
15:17,SM:," It is a different tape. I am going to hold it here and I will double check a hook or something. Okay, we are talking about Alcatraz.",
15:27,PS:,"Right, Alcatraz.",
15:28,SM:,Why? What was its purpose and what were its goals? And how important was it with respect to the American Indian Movement?,
15:39,PS:,"Well, Alcatraz came about because the United States closed its maximum security prison on the island. So it became a question of what would happen, you know, to this amazing piece of real estate with all those gorgeous views of San Francisco Bay. And so there were various ideas of luxury housing and some kind of a resort and all these things that were not very practical because Alcatraz was, you know, the most secure prison in the country for a really good reason which is very difficult to get there. So the idea of having condominiums there and a shopping center and all that was not very realistic. And so the urban Indian community in the Bay Area, thought you know, well actually, we should get Alcatraz. So there were California Indian folks that had been pursuing various you know, actions towards redress for many years. The Urban Indian Center in San Francisco that had suffered a disastrous fire so they needed a place, and you know, everybody's talking about Alcatraz in the Bay Area. So all of that turned into a ̶ you know, a few dozen college students organizing a takeover on the island. This was in November 1969. So landing on, you know, getting those from Sausalito to be on Alcatraz overnight, you know, was an adventure but not incredibly hard to do. What really changed the event was the fact that it was because it was federal property it became a first a General Services Administration issue and then it went to the White House on how to handle these protesters. And Richard Nixon at that point, the new president, you know, was sort of shopping for a model minority, a minority group where he could, you know, build a good record. So, he had these high level advisors, one of them was Leonard Garment that saw an opportunity to, you know, be in dialogue with these protesters to explore possibilities for the administration to show their good faith for this minority group. So it all could have ended in a day or two. But the decision by the Nixon White House to actually negotiate with the occupiers, turned it into a very different thing and elevated the event to a whole other level. So it actually lasted for a year and a half, the occupation. And so it got, it never got the kind of attention people want to remember it as getting. It was, you know, it was in the national news maybe once or twice. It was a big story in the Bay Area for quite a while. It was, you know, like a lot of like a lot of the activism that Robert Warrior and I talked about in your book, it was sort of heroic and smart, and also badly planned. For there is a period of months in which people talked about it as a Lord of the Flies situation. You know, it is sort of the downside of having this wonderfully open movement that anybody can join. It means you get, you know, criminals and drug dealers and thugs being part of it. And very idealistic people. So it was that kind of a mixed bag. But I guess what was so startling about it was the idea that Indians would do something like that. Would occupy, would break the law and occupy federal territory. I think for a lot of Native people had internalized this idea that we would never do something like that. And so it was kind of amazing to a lot of Indian people. Apart from the particular demands, or who the groups were; the individuals, it was just wow, Indians did that. That's pretty amazing.",Alcatraz
